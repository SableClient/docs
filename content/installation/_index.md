# Getting started
The web app is available at [app.sable.moe](https://app.sable.moe/) and gets updated on frequently, as soon as a feature is deemed stable.

Native desktop and mobile builds are still being worked on in [#88](https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/issues/88). For now, use the web app directly, or [install it as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your phone.](https://www.installpwa.com/from/app.sable.moe)

# Self-hosting
You have a few options for self hosting, you can:
1. Run the prebuilt docker container.
2. Deploy on a site like GitLab Pages. Jae has a [guide here](https://docs.j4.lc/Tutorials/Deploying-Sable-on-GitLab-Pages).
3. Build it yourself.

## Docker

Prebuilt images are published to `ghcr.io/sableclient/sable`.

- `latest` tracks the current `dev` branch image.
- `X.Y.Z` tags are versioned releases.
- `X.Y` tags float within a release line.
- Pushes to `dev` also publish a short commit SHA tag.

Run the latest image with:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/sableclient/sable:latest
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

If you want to override the bundled [`config.json`](config.json), mount your own
file at `/app/config.json`:

```yaml
services:
  sable:
    image: ghcr.io/sableclient/sable:latest
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json:ro
```

## Build it yourself

To build and serve Sable yourself with nginx, clone this repo and build it:

```sh
pnpm i # Installs all dependencies
pnpm run build # Compiles the app into the dist/ directory
```

After that, you can copy the dist/ directory to your server and serve it.

* In the [`config.json`](config.json), you can modify the default homeservers, feature rooms/spaces, toggle the account switcher, and toggle experimental simplified slilding sync support.

* To deploy on subdirectory, you need to rebuild the app youself after updating the `base` path in [`build.config.ts`](build.config.ts).
    * For example, if you want to deploy on `https://sable.moe/app`, then set `base: '/app'`.
